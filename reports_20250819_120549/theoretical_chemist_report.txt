ABSTRACT
----------------------------------------

Based on the provided publication report, the theoretical models and computational parameters used in the study of acridine polymorphs, crystal structure prediction, and thermodynamic phase transition modeling are not explicitly detailed. However, some insights can be inferred from the key publications listed.

One relevant study is the AlphaCrystal-II, which uses a deep learning-based approach for crystal structure prediction [8]. The exact theoretical models and computational parameters are not specified in the abstract, but it's clear that machine learning, specifically deep learning, is being used to predict crystal structures. This suggests that machine learning models are being applied to similar systems, such as crystalline structures.

Another publication titled "Autonomous Inorganic Materials Discovery via Multi-Agent Physics-Aware Scientific Reasoning" discusses the use of machine learning for accurate property prediction and targeted material generation [6]. However, the specific computational methods, models, and parameters are not mentioned in the abstract.

The report also mentions a publication titled "Beyond Model Base Selection: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design" [5]. This study seems to focus on the application of machine learning in database systems, but it's unclear if this has any direct relevance to the study of acridine polymorphs and crystal structure prediction.

The report does not provide specific information on the accuracy and limitations of the theoretical predictions, nor does it mention recent advances in computational techniques for this area.

In conclusion, while the report indicates that machine learning, and specifically deep learning, is being used in the prediction of crystal structures [8], the specific theoretical models, computational parameters, and DFT applications are not explicitly detailed. The accuracy and limitations of these theoretical predictions, as well as recent advances in computational techniques, are also not discussed in the report. Further information would be required to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
