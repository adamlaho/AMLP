ABSTRACT
----------------------------------------

1. **How VASP can be used to address the research question**

VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package) is a powerful tool for performing density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations, which are essential for accurate lattice energy calculations and energy difference predictions between acridine polymorphs. VASP can be used to model solid-state phase transitions and predict crystal structures, which are crucial for understanding polymorph stability and thermodynamic phase transition modeling within crystalline systems [3,8].

2. **Specific computational parameters and settings recommended**

VASP's plane-wave basis set, along with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, can be used for these calculations. The exchange-correlation functional should be chosen based on the system under study; for example, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) or the local density approximation (LDA) could be used. A realistic non-collinear ground state may be beneficial for certain systems [8].

The energy cut-off for the plane-wave basis set and the k-point grid in the Brillouin zone need to be carefully tested to ensure convergence. For accurate lattice energy calculations, it's recommended to use the Murnaghan equation of state to fit the energy-volume data obtained from VASP calculations.

3. **Methodological approaches relevant to the query**

The research query involves a combination of DFT and machine learning. In this context, DFT can be used to generate training data for machine learning models, which can then be used to predict properties of interest for a larger set of materials. For example, DFT can be used to calculate the lattice energies of a set of known acridine polymorphs, and these data can then be used to train a machine learning model to predict the lattice energies of other polymorphs [9].

4. **Expected accuracy and limitations**

The accuracy of DFT calculations depends on the choice of exchange-correlation functional, which is an approximation. Some functionals may provide more accurate results for certain systems or properties than others. The accuracy of machine learning predictions depends on the quality and quantity of the training data, as well as the appropriateness of the chosen machine learning model for the task at hand.

The main limitation of DFT is that it is a mean-field theory and does not accurately capture correlation effects, which can be important in some systems. Machine learning models are limited by their inability to predict properties outside the range of the training data.

5. **Literature precedents where available**

A recent publication introduced VASPilot, a platform that automates VASP simulations, which could be useful for large-scale DFT calculations [3]. Another publication compared the performance of VASP and a deep neural network potential for calculating bulk formation and surface energies in various materials [9]. These works could provide useful insights for the proposed research.
